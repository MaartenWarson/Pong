# Pong
 
## General Summary
For the subject **iTalent** within my training at the PXL Hogeschool in Hasselt, I have been tasked to create some applications in a programming language or technology I am not familier with. The goal of this project is to touch the Python programming language for the first time in my career. In my education this language is not included in the curriculum, and since the importance of this language is huge, I feel I needed to experiment with this language.

I have created the classic game Pong. The user has the option to start/end te game at own will, and there is also a score limit implemented. The player who scores the first five points, wins the game.

Enjoy!
